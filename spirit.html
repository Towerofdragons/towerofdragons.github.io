                <h1>Tourism Destinations In the Mara</h1>
    
                <p>Kenya is a renowned destination for travelers seeking diverse experiences, from stunning landscapes to rich cultural heritage.
                     At the heart of this experience is the Maasai Mara, one of Africaâ€™s most iconic wildlife reserves. 
                     Known for its breathtaking annual Great Migration, Kenya offers unparalleled opportunities for visitors to witness nature in its purest form. From the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kenya to the sun-soaked beaches of the Indian Ocean, Kenya is a land of contrasts, where adventure and serenity meet.
                     I'll be including the incredible properties I visited in the Maasai Mara as a testament to the quality of the hospitality industry around tourism.</p>
                <p>Tourism contributes to quite a large part of the Kenyan economy.</p>

                <h5>What drove me to making this?</h5>

                <p>Between semesters I had a brief stint in which I was a technical 
                    support intern at a mainly tours safaris company.
                </p>
                <p>For my first job(formal employment) ever, I got to travel a bit.</p>
                <p> Of course, I was mostly to watch and learn setting up reservation management and point of sale systems. It wasn't particularly interesting.</p>
                <p>However, the rest of the trip was pretty neat! Therefore, I made a few pages talking about the properties we visited.</p>
